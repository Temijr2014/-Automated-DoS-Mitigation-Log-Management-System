# 🛡️Automated-DoS-Mitigation-Log-Management-System
This project demonstrates how to defend a Linux server against Denial of Service (DoS) SYN Flood attacks using a layered defense strategy.By integrating UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) as a sensor and Fail2Ban as an automated response engine, the system detects high-velocity attack patterns and dynamically updates kernel-level firewall rules to drop malicious traffic.

# 🛠️ Technology Stack
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Victim)
- Attack Tool: Kali Linux (hping3)
- Firewall: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Automation: Fail2Ban
- Log Management: Logrotate

# 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. UFW Configuration
First, the firewall was configured to block unauthorized traffic and, crucially, to log these events.
```
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw logging medium  # Ensures SRC IP data is captured for Fail2Ban
```

# Custom Fail2Ban Filter
A custom filter was created to parse the UFW logs. This allows Fail2Ban to identify the specific string generated by a blocked packet.
- Command
```
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ufw-dos.conf
```
- Paste this exact content
```
[Definition]
failregex = \[UFW BLOCK\].*SRC=<HOST>
ignoreregex =
```
# The Breakdown
[Definition]
This is just a header. It tells the computer: "Everything below this line is the definition of my search rule."

failregex = (The Search Rule)
This is the most important part. It tells Fail2Ban: "If you see a line that looks like this, it counts as a failure (an attack)."

Here is what the code inside is doing:

\[UFW BLOCK\]: Look for the specific label the firewall puts on blocked traffic.

.*: This is a "skip" command. It means "skip over all the random junk in the middle" (like dates, times, and MAC addresses).

SRC=: Look for the word "Source."

<HOST>: This is a special code for the IP Address. It tells Fail2Ban: "Take whatever numbers are here and remember them so we can ban that person."

ignoreregex = (The "Exceptions" List)
This is usually left blank. It tells Fail2Ban: "Are there any lines that look like an attack but should be ignored?"

Example: If you wanted to make sure you never accidentally banned your own laptop, you could put your laptop's IP address here as an exception. Since it’s empty, Fail2Ban will treat every single block it finds as a potential attack.

# The "Human Translation"
Fail2Ban: "Hey, look through the firewall logs. Every time you see a line that mentions a [UFW BLOCK], find the Source IP (SRC). If that same IP shows up too many times, throw them in jail!"

# DoS Jail Implementation
The "Jail" defines the threshold for an attack. If an IP is blocked by UFW 100 times within 1 minute, it is banned at the kernel level for 1 hour.
- Command
```
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
- Paste this exact content
```
[ufw-dos]
enabled  = true
filter   = ufw-dos
logpath  = /var/log/ufw.log
maxretry = 100
findtime = 1m
bantime  = 1h
```
# Solving the Performance Bottleneck
During testing, the log file reached 331MB (1.2M+ lines), causing a processing lag in Fail2Ban. To resolve this, Logrotate was reconfigured to move from time-based rotation (weekly) to size-based rotation.

- Open the UFW rotate config
 ```
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/ufw
#Add su root syslog as the first line inside the curly brackets {.
```
- paste this there
```
/var/log/ufw.log
{
    su root syslog    # <--- ADD THIS LINE
    rotate 10
    size 50M
    missingok
    notifempty
    compress
    delaycompress
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        [ -x /usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog-rotate ] && /usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog-rotate || true
    endscript
}
```

- Save and Exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).
# Why su root syslog?
On Ubuntu, the /var/log directory is typically owned by the user root and the group syslog. By adding this line, you are telling logrotate: "I know the permissions look broad, but just use the standard system permissions (root:syslog) to do the work. Don't worry, it's safe."

- Updated Config: /etc/logrotate.d/ufw
- Key Change: Added size 50M and su root syslog to ensure the log file remains small enough for instant parsing.

# ⚔️ Attack Simulation & Results
The Attack
From the Kali Linux machine, a SYN Flood attack was launched:
```
sudo hping3 -S --flood -V -p 80 [Target_IP]
```
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="screen shot 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b025822-3346-4ce7-8201-fe56178f2c17" />

# The Defense (Observation)
By monitoring the Fail2Ban status, the system successfully identified the flood and moved the attacker's IP into the banned list.
Verification Command:
```
sudo fail2ban-client status ufw-dos
```
<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="screen shot 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eabd4f9-a61c-441b-ae51-849b035edd08" />

# Results
Before Mitigation: CPU usage spiked as UFW struggled to process 100k+ packets/sec.
After Mitigation: Fail2Ban updated the iptables rules to DROP the traffic. CPU usage returned to normal levels (< 5%) as the kernel discarded packets before they reached the application layer.

# 📖 Key Takeaways
- Defense in Depth: Firewalls alone can be exhausted; automation (Fail2Ban) is required to stop the resource drain.
- Hygiene: Security tools are only as fast as the logs they read. Proper log rotation is critical for real-time response.
- Kernel-Level Dropping: Using DROP instead of REJECT during a DoS attack saves significant CPU cycles.
